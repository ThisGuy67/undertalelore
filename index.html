        <p> This is completley unaffliated with Toby Fox, or anyone in the Undertale/Deltarune team. This is purely fanmade, and is only made for fun as my interpretation. If you wish to give criticism on any of my theories, my email is below. </p>

        <p> By the way, the pacifist route is canon, so I will use it for the full story </p>

        <h2>The Prologue</h2>
        <p>Long ago, there lived 2 species. Humans, and monsters. They lived in peace. Despite their peace, there was a huge diffrence, regarding their SOULs. A human SOUL has a power called "Determination." This power allows the Human SOUL to persist after death of the body. Most monsters do not have determination, and simply explode into dust uopn death. However, the most powerful of them all, have some determination, howver their SOUL will be very unstable. The Human's weakness, ironcically, was the power of their soul. A monster with a human soul, would be a being with unfathomable power. A being capable of destroying the universe. Scared of this, the Humans declared war on the monsters. However, it was'nt all Humans vs Monsters. Some Humans fought on the monster's side. In the end, the humans lost, and they sealed the monsters underground, with all the magical power left among them. To cross the barrier, someone would need the power of 1 determined monster soul, and 1 human soul. To shatter the barrier we would need the power of 7 human souls. All the monsters in the underground, is only euqivalent to 1 human soul.</p>

        <h2>Prolouge 2</h2>
        <p>The underground, the land of the monsters, is divided into 5 main parts. HOME, where the barrier is, after HOME, is hotland, which is a hot land. After hotland, is waterfall, a marsh with many waterfalls and a garbage dump. There Snowdin, which basically a forever winter land. There is RUINS. Its just a ruined labyrinth. You will notice that these names are extremley terrible. A monster from Snowdin is quoted saying, "As great as our King is, he is very lousy at names" As for important monsters, there is King Asgore, Queen Toriel, Prince Asriel, Royal Scientist WD Gaster, and head of the royal guard Gerson. There is also Sans the skeleton, he starts as normal skeleton, but becomes very important later. Alphys and Sans, for now, are assistants to Gaster, and Undyne is an assistant to Gerson. To power the underground, Asgore tasked Gaster with making the Core. The core now sits in between hotland and HOME.</P>

        <h2>The First Human</h2>
        <h3>Mount Ebott, 201X </h3>
        <p> It is said that those who climb Mount Ebott are said to never return. A child human, by the name of Chara, decided to climb anyway. Upon reaching the top, she tripped on some vines, and fell into the underground. The fell into the RUINS, on a bed of golden flowers. She unable to move due to pain. She called for help, until eventually, Asriel found her. The Royals family treated Chara as a second child. Eventually, Chara fell very ill. It is said she put buttercups instead of cups of butter into a pie, while the monsters recovered, Chara did not. She died the next day. Chara's last wish to Asirel was to be brought to the surface, and to see the flowers of her village. When Chara died, Asriel absorbed her soul, crossed the barrrier, and brought her to the surface. Once he entered Chara's village, the humans thoguht Asriel had killed the inncent youth. The attacked him with all their might. Asriel has the unfathomable power to destroy them all, yet he didn't attack a single human. He put Chara to rest, and somehow made it back alive, but for long. He died in HOME's garden, his dust spreading across it. From that area, bloomed a bed of golden flowers. The entire underground was struck by grief. ASgore and Toriel had lost 2 children in 1 day. Asgore declared that any human that falls down into the underground must be killed immediatley. Toriel, finding this very cruel, left Asgore into hiding in the ruins, vowing to protect any human that falls down. She locked the door between the ruins and snowdin, ensuring Asgore couldn't enter.</p>
        <h2> The six humans</h2>
        <p> Overtime, 6 humans, all children, fell into the underground. Despite Toriel's attempts to protect them, the fled the ruins. Gerson killed at least one, but most fled him, too. Until they met Asgore. They were right in front of the barrier, with no where to flee too. Considering they were children, they didn't stnad a chance against ruthless Asgore. All they needed was one more, but it was taking forever. In this time, Gerson retired, losing his determination, but Undyne took his place.</p>
        <h2> The Gaster incident </h2>
        <p> With how long it was taking for the next human to fall, Asgore tasked Gaster with trying to artifically create a human soul. He built an ordinary looking lab on the surface, and the true lab underneath. In the true lab, he discovered determination, the power whoch allows souls to persist. With the help of his assistants, he began experimanting He tried to inject determination into dying monsters. It seemed to work, the mosters came back to life, and they exhibited normal behavior, until the next day. Gaster discovered that determination in ordinary monsters would cause them to melt and fuse together, creating something called an "Amalgamate." He then had the brilliant idea of injecting determination into himslef. He thought he was diffrent, since he had determination already, that he would only be stregnthed, giving himslef the power of a human soul. It did not work. While he did not "die" his essence was shattered acorss spae and time, and channelling his power into the only nearby vessels, Alphys and Sans. Of course, these two weren't stable vessels, so two other vessels were created. For Sans, Papyrus was created. He was just a normal skeleton, with huge amounts of power, and low amounts of mental capacity. For Alphys, Mettaton was created. He was litterally a calculator, but also had high amounts of power. Alphys took the role of the next Royal Scientist, Mettaton became a TV star. Undyne saw the immense power of the four, and gave them some assignments on top of what they were doing. Sans retired from science, and was assigned by Undyne to watch for humans in snowdin. Alphys was told to install cameras everywhere but the ruins, to keep an eye for humans, aminly in hotland though, because that's where the lab was located. Mettaton was given a body, and was programmed to be a bloodthirsty human killing machine, undercover of the normal TV Star. Undyne stationed herself in waterfall. </p>
        <h2> True lab 2</h2>
        <p> Alphys still wanted to continue the experiments with determination. She thought, if she injected determination into something without a soul, it would be a successful vessel. She picked the first golden flower that bloomed from Asriel's dust. It seemed to gain life. The next day, the flower, now known as "Flowey" had run away. Flowey was a soulless embodiement of Asriel. He went to HOME, to see his parents again. He only found Asgore. When they met, he felt something strange. No matter how much Asgore cried and apologized, Flowey didn't feel anything. After all, he was a soulless flower. He couldn't feel emotion. He went to the ruins, to try to feel emotion from his mom, nothing. </p>
        <h2> Flowey's Shennagins </h2>
        <p> Flowey discovered these little stars around the world. When he "saved" on these stars, they would act as "save points" when he died, he'd go back to the last "save point" he saved at. He could aslo "reset" his entire progress. Or he could "load" a file. If he killed someone, and didn't save, he could the previous save, and that person would be back alive, with no memory of what happened. He spent years experimenting, and testing every single possibility of what he could do. But the only thing that never happened acroos billions of saves and resets, was Asgore showing Flowey the human souls. No matter how much flowey tried to get Asgore to show them, Asgore never did.</p>    
        <h2> The Prophecy </h2>
        <p> There was a prophecy, called the Delta Rune. It said that an angel, someone who had seen the surface, (a human) would fall into the underground, and the underground will go empty. This was interpreted in 3 ways. 1, that the human would wreck genocide, and thus an empty underground, or that the human be a pacifist, and bring everyone to the surface with his soul and the other 6. Or, that he would be killed, and Asgore would use the 7 souls to bring everyone to the surface. </p>
        <h2> The seventh human </h2>
        <p> A human by the name of Frisk fell into the underground. Flowey tried to steal his soul, but Toriel saved Frisk. This encounter took away Flowey's save ability, and it was given to Frisk. He fled the ruins, fled snowdin, but insted of continuing like the rest of them, he went back to snowdin. HE took the time to befirend Papyrus. When he fled waterfall, he went back and befirended Undyne. In hotland, he befriended Alphys and Mettaton. He gained such trust among the monsters, that before meeting Asgore, Undyne, who had a crush on Alphys, tasked Frisk with delivering her love letter to Alphys. After the ordeal with Undyne, Alphys (and Papyrus for some reason) Frisk went back to the lab. He saw a not left by Alpys, basically telling to go into the now unlocked elevator and explore the true lab. When Frisk gets there, Flowey cuts off all power, so Frisk has to explore the true lab, and encounter all the amalgamates. He finally reaches the power grid, and as he is about to restore power, he is surrounded by amalgamates. Alphys comes and saves Frisk, and Frisk encourages Alphys to tell the truth. Frisk returns to HOME, ready to encounter Asgore. However, there is one part of HOME, the judgement hall. All 6 previous humans also went there. It is where Sans judges you, for every action, every decision you made. For Frisk's pure and true pacifist route, sans congratulates him and leaves him alone. All the time Frisk spent in the true lab, it gave Toriel the time to leave the ruins, and make it all the way to HOME, just in time for Frisk's encounter with Asgore. When Asgore is about to begin his attacks, Toriel comes and saves Frisk. From there, every single primary monster he befriended (except mettaton, he didnt want to be included for some reason) comes in for a really wholesome interaction. It is said that Papyrus called them all here, except for Toriel who came of her own accord. In the end, it's Frisk, Asgore, Undyne, Alphys, Toriel, Sans, and Papyrus all in one big circle, having a noce conversation. Wehn Alphys asks Papyrus why he called everyone, Papyrus says "A tiny little flower helped me." This is when Flowey reveals that, while Frisk was interacting, Flowey finally found and absorbed the 6 souls. His final target? Frisk. He begins to mercillesly attack Frisk, until he is on the brink of death. Then The monsters begin using what little power they have left to protect Frisk. From there, every single monster in the underground appears, discouraging Flowey from killing Frisk. Flowey, being emotionless, Takes every single soul available to him, the 6 humans, and the monsters. With all this power, he is finally able to attain Asriel form. Asriel wants to take Frisk's soul and become a god. With 100s of souls, he is already named "The absoloute god of hyperdeath" During the "fight" Frisk keeps being a pacifist, and manages to rescure the lost souls, being the asriel controlled primary monsters. But there is still one more person left to save - Asriel himself. Asriel, now being able to feel emotion, gets really emotional over this, and stops trying to kill Frisk. Asriel decides to use the 6 human souls, plus all the monster souls in the underground, to shatter the barrier, before returning to flower form. All the monsters and Frisk return to the surface, and everyone has a happy ending, except for Flowey, because he is a flower and is bound to soils of the underground. </p>
